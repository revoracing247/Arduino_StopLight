# Arduino_StopLight
Holds all files relating to my StopLight desk light project using an arduino nano, motion sensor, button, and three rows of Red/Yellow/Green lights.

- This project is mainly just for a christmas present for a close friend of mine. Don't expect much updates from me as i pretty much have the code where i want it already.
